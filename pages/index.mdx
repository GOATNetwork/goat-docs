# Welcome to the GOAT Docs
Welcome to the GOAT Network documentation! This comprehensive guide is designed to help developers, node operators, wallet providers, and other stakeholders effectively utilize the GOAT Network. Here, you will find detailed information on the core concepts, tools, and processes essential for building and maintaining applications on the GOAT Protocol.

## What is GOAT?

GOAT Network is an advanced Layer 2 solution built on top of Bitcoin, leveraging cutting-edge technologies like Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) and the Zero-Knowledge Machine (ZKM). ZKM is integral to GOAT Network, providing a trustless and universal settlement infrastructure. Together, these technologies enhance scalability, security, and decentralization. GOAT Network aims to provide a robust platform for developing decentralized applications (DApps) while ensuring the integrity and efficiency of transactions.


**Key Features**
- **Scalability**: Process a high volume of transactions off-chain while ensuring they are securely settled on-chain.
- **Security**: Utilize native Bitcoin Multisig and advanced cryptographic proofs to maintain robust security.
- **Decentralization**: Employ decentralized sequencers and verifiers to prevent single points of failure and ensure trustlessness.
- **Interoperability**: Facilitate seamless asset transfers and data exchanges between Bitcoin and GOAT Network through trustless bridges.
