# Welcome to the GOAT Docs
Welcome to the GOAT Network documentation! This comprehensive guide is designed to help developers, node operators, wallet providers, and other stakeholders effectively utilize the GOAT Network. Here, you will find detailed information on the core concepts, tools, and processes essential for building and maintaining applications on the GOAT Protocol.

## Learn About GOAT 
The GOAT network is unique in many ways. It is an EVM equivelant Layer 2 on Bitcoin. The GOAT Network introduces an Optimistic Challenge Protocol (GOAT-OCP) on BitVM2, combining it with ZKM Entangled Rollupâ€™s trust-minimized and universal settlement infrastructure to achieve the most decentralized and secure Bitcoin Layer 2 (L2) solution.
