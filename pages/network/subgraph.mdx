# Subgraph

Subgraphs are open-source, configurable indexing tools that allow developers to extract, organize, and serve blockchain data through a standardized GraphQL API. By defining the data schema and mappings, subgraphs enable applications to query blockchain events and state changes with speed and precision—making them essential components for building responsive, data-rich Web3 experiences.
## About Sentio

Sentio provides modern monitoring, alerting, log management and debugging for decentralized applications as an integrated and hosted experience.

Developers can use Sentio’s SDK to collect and transform metrics and event-logs generated based on their smart contracts’ events, transactions, traces and states. Sentio fully manages the indexing process, and users can visualize and set up alerts on the metrics and perform advanced search on the logs, all via Sentio’s web interface.
