# Subgraph

Subgraphs are open-source, configurable indexing tools that allow developers to extract, organize, and serve blockchain data through a standardized GraphQL API. By defining the data schema and mappings, subgraphs enable applications to query blockchain events and state changes with speed and precisionâ€”making them essential components for building responsive, data-rich Web3 experiences.


## 0xgraph
