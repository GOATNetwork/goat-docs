# Bridged Token Addresses

Various ERC-20 tokens originally deployed to Ethereum also have corresponding "bridged" representations on GOAT Mainnet.

## Token Addresses

| Token | Mainnet Address | Testnet Address |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| WBTC | 0x... (coming soon) | 0xTestWBTC... |
| USDC | 0x... (coming soon) | 0xTestUSDC... |
| USDT | 0x... (coming soon) | 0xTestUSDT... |
| DAI | 0x... (coming soon) | 0xTestDAI... |

## Bridge Process

The bridging process involves the following steps:

1. **Lock tokens on L1**: Users lock their tokens in the bridge contract on Bitcoin
2. **Proof generation**: The bridge generates a proof of the lock
3. **Mint on L2**: Corresponding tokens are minted on GOAT Network
4. **Verification**: The transaction is verified through ZKM's infrastructure

## Bridge Security

The bridge security is maintained through:
- n-of-n multisig validation
- ZKM's trustless bridge protocol
- Decentralized verification network
- Economic security guarantees
