# Security Model & FAQ
The GOAT Network's security model is designed to ensure the safety, integrity, and trustlessness of off-chain computations and transactions. The network leverages advanced cryptographic techniques, decentralized protocols, and a robust challenge-response mechanism to maintain high security standards.

## Key Security Components

### Trust-Minimized Design 
   - **State Liveness and Safety**: The state is live if it can be consumed by its owner within a finite time and safe if it cannot be consumed by non-owners. The GOAT Network ensures both state liveness and safety, preventing assets from being locked or stolen indefinitely.
   - **n-of-n Multisig**: Utilizes native Bitcoin Multisig scripts for asset security, ensuring that transactions require multiple signatures for validation, which enhances security and prevents unauthorized access.

### Permissionless Participation
   - The GOAT Network allows any Bitcoin holder to participate as a sequencer node by staking their BTC or delegating it to an existing node. This inclusivity fosters a diverse and resilient ecosystem, reducing barriers to entry and preventing centralization.

### Decentralized Sequencer Network
   - Ensures that no single entity can control the transaction order or manipulate the network. The decentralized sequencers sort transactions through a consensus mechanism, preventing censorship and single points of failure.

### Optimistic Challenge Protocol (GOAT-OCP)
   - Any participant can challenge the validity of off-chain computations. If a challenge is raised, a counter-proof must be provided to validate the transaction. Successful challenges invalidate incorrect transactions, maintaining the network's integrity.

### Data Availability (DA)
   - Ensures that all transaction data is accessible and verifiable by every node, preventing data withholding attacks and ensuring transparency.

### Cryptographic Security
- Zero-knowledge proofs for privacy
- Multi-party computation for consensus
- Threshold signatures for validation
- Hash-based commitment schemes

### Economic Security
- locked-based Decentralized Sequencer selection. 
- BitVM2 OCP Challenge incentives
- Slashing conditions for Operators, (ie : existential honesty)
- Reward distribution (~30% is shared to the Sequencers, and the rest is Distributed towards BTC delegates)

### Network Security
- Decentralized sequencer network, branched from the original (Metis) Decentralized Sequencer framework
- "Comet" Byzantine fault tolerance
- Sybil resistance
- MEV protection using ZKM.

## Security Analysis

The security of the GOAT Network is based on its decentralized, trust-minimized, and permissionless architecture. The network's resilience is enhanced by its ability to handle challenges and verify proofs, ensuring that any dishonest behavior is promptly detected and penalized.

### Key Assumptions
1. **At Least One Honest Sequencer**:
   - The network assumes at least one honest sequencer staker. This one-time setup with a 1-of-n honesty assumption ensures that anyone can challenge invalid assertions during runtime.

2. **Honest Challengers**:
   - The assumption is that honest challengers will always win successful challenges, ensuring the network remains secure and trustworthy.

3. **Economic Incentives**:
   - Misbehaving stakers are penalized economically by losing their staking assets, incentivizing honest participation.

## FAQ

### What is the GOAT Network?
The GOAT Network is an advanced Layer 2 solution built on Bitcoin, leveraging Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) and the Zero-Knowledge Machine (ZKM) for scalable and secure off-chain computations.

### How does the GOAT Network ensure security?
The GOAT Network employs a trust-minimized design, decentralized sequencer network, and the Optimistic Challenge Protocol (GOAT-OCP) to ensure high levels of security and trustlessness.

### What is the role of n-of-n Multisig in the GOAT Network?
n-of-n Multisig is used to secure assets by requiring multiple signatures for transactions, preventing unauthorized access and ensuring the integrity of asset transfers between layers.

### How can I participate in the GOAT Network?
Any Bitcoin holder can participate by staking their BTC to become a sequencer node or by delegating their stake to an existing node. This permissionless participation model enhances the network's resilience and decentralization.

### What happens during a challenge in the GOAT Network?
If a transaction is challenged, a counter-proof must be provided. If the challenge is successful, the transaction is invalidated, and the misbehaving staker is penalized. If the challenge fails, the transaction is confirmed.

### How does the GOAT Network handle data availability?
The network ensures that all transaction data is accessible and verifiable by every node, preventing data withholding attacks and ensuring transparency.

### What are the economic incentives for honest behavior in the GOAT Network?
Participants are incentivized to act honestly as misbehavior results in the slashing of their financial stake, while honest challengers are rewarded for identifying and proving invalid transactions.

### General Security Questions
