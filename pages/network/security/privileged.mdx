# Privileged Access

The GOAT Network aims to be fully decentralized. In its current state, however, certain roles require privileged access to perform specific functions. These roles are essential for the network's operation and security. The following sections outline the privileged access roles and permissions on the GOAT Network.

A coalition of operators who operate the n-of-n Multisig. Each Operator should be able to act as a OCP Prover. A OCP Prover can operate the asset peg-off for the end-user and kick off the asset transaction for any off-chain computation.
