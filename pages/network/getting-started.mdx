# Getting Started Developing on GOAT Network
This guide explains the basics of GOAT Mainnet development. GOAT Mainnet is EVM equivelant, which means we run a slightly modified version of the same `geth` client that Ethereum uses. 
This means that you can use the same tools and libraries that you would use for Ethereum development. A few differences do exist, however, and this guide will help you navigate those differences.


## Goat Network RPC Endpoints
To access any Ethereum type network you need an endpoint. [These providers](/builders/tools/connect/rpc-providers) support our networks.


## Development Stacks

As you can see in the different development stacks below, the way you deploy contracts and interact with them on GOAT is almost identical to the way you do it with L1 Ethereum.
The most visible difference is that you have to specify a different endpoint (of course).
