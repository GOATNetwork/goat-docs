## Contract Interactions

When interacting with these contracts:

1. Use the latest verified contract ABIs from the explorer
2. Ensure you're connected to the correct network (Testnet: Chain ID 48816)
3. Follow security best practices for contract interactions
4. Test interactions on testnet before mainnet deployment
