### 4. Quest Design and Point Allocation

- Create engaging user quests
- Strategically allocate points
- Define quest parameters and objectives

**Integrating Points with Quests:**

- Founders use the points allocated to them to design quests that align with their project's goals.

- **Process:**
  - **Allocate Points to Contracts:** Distribute points to your project's smart contracts using the FoundersClub smart contract functions.
  - **Design Quests:** Use the allocated points to create quests within your application.
  - **Monitor Points Usage:** Track how points are being used and converted into user rewards.

- **Example:**
  - Allocate 10,000 points to a contract.
  - Create a quest where users earn 100 points per completed action.
  - Monitor the `currentPoints` and `pendingRewards` through the smart contract.

**Note:** All points are subject to change and are here for demonstration purposes only. The initial founders that applied between April 30th - December 7th had applied for the 10,000,000 points. All point/reward ratios will be announced and updated post mainnet launch.
