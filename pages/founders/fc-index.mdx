# GOAT Founders Club: Blockchain Innovation Ecosystem

<Callout type="info">
  Discover how to build with GOAT Network and join the Founders Club.
</Callout>

## Introduction

We welcome you to the GOAT Networkâ€™s Founders Club and are excited to be building with you to revolutionize Bitcoin (UTXO). Our team of financial experts and world-class tech professionals believes that by leveraging Layer 2 blockchain technologies, we can scale Bitcoin with the power of cryptography alone.

GOAT NETWORK has developed a Bitcoin Layer 2 solution that integrates an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The GOAT Network uses its own native Wrapped Bitcoin gas token, `goatBTC`. This 1:1 BTC token can be used for staking, which in turn generates yield tokens, `$yBTC` and the `$GOAT` ecosystem token.

## Getting Started

- **$yBTC:** Yield-bearing token earned by staking `goatBTC`.
- **$GOAT:** Ecosystem token used for various rewards and governance.

### Understanding GOAT Tokens

- Staking `goatBTC` returns `$yBTC`, earning you incoming gas fees in `goatBTC` and mining rewards in `$GOAT` tokens.
- `$yBTC` includes the underlying `goatBTC` and the yield.
- `$GOAT` tokens can boost yield rewards when staked.
