- Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) integration
- Native Wrapped Bitcoin gas token (goatBTC)
- Yield generation mechanisms ($yBTC and $GOAT)
- Decentralized sequencer network

<Callout type="warning">
  The Bitcoin Locking Script is managed by a decentralized set of sequencers running GOAT Network's Ethereum execution environment.

## Native GOAT Tokens

### Token Ecosystem

<div className="mt-8">
  | Token | Type | Description |
  |-------|------|-------------|
  | goatBTC | Gas Token | 1:1 BTC-backed token for network operations |
  | $yBTC | Yield Token | Earned through staking goatBTC |
  | $GOAT | Ecosystem Token | Mined from staked Gas or Yield tokens |
</div>

<Callout type="info">
  Staking $GOAT boosts token yield rewards! Staked goatBTC returns $yBTC, earning users gas fees in goatBTC and mining rewards in $GOAT Tokens.
</Callout>

## Bridge & Yield Mechanisms

### Bitcoin Layer 1 Staking

<Callout type="success">
  Bridge your Bitcoin to GOAT Network and earn both goatBTC and $GOAT rewards through the native bridge system.
</Callout>

The staking process provides multiple benefits:
- 1:1 BTC to goatBTC minting
- Automatic yield generation
- Decentralized sequencer participation
- Network security enhancement
