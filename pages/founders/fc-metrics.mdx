# Metrics that Matter: DAU, TRX, and TVL

<Callout type="info">
  Key performance indicators that drive blockchain project success and community engagement
</Callout>

## Overview of Blockchain Metrics

In the GOAT Founders Club Ecosystem, three critical metrics provide insights into project health and user engagement:
- Daily Active Users (DAU)
- Transactions (TRX)
- Total Value Locked (TVL)

## Daily Active Users (DAU)

### What is DAU?

<Callout type="default">
  DAU represents the number of unique users interacting with a project within a 24-hour period.
</Callout>

#### Measurement Methodology
- Counts unique wallet addresses
- Tracks meaningful interactions
- Excludes repeated actions from the same user

### Importance for Founders

- Directly measures project popularity and user retention
- Evaluate the effectiveness of user acquisition strategies
- Create targeted challenges to boost daily interactions

### DAU Calculation Example

```typescript
function calculateDAU(interactions: UserInteraction[]): number {
  const uniqueUsers = new Set(
    interactions
      .filter(interaction => isWithin24Hours(interaction.timestamp))
      .map(interaction => interaction.walletAddress)
  );
  
  return uniqueUsers.size;
}
```

## Transactions (TRX)

### What are Transactions?

<Callout type="default">
  TRX represents the total number of interactions within a project's smart contracts.
</Callout>

#### Transaction Types
- Token transfers
- Swaps
- Staking activities
- Contract calls

### Significance for Founders

- Indicates economic vitality
- Reflects network usage
- Potential revenue generation
- Measures user engagement
- Identifies popular features
- Guides product development
- Higher transactions can mean more fees
- Attracts potential investors
- Demonstrates project utility

### TRX Tracking Code

```typescript
interface TransactionRecord {
  type: 'transfer' | 'swap' | 'stake';
  volume: number;
  timestamp: Date;
}

function calculateTotalTransactions(records: TransactionRecord[]): number {
  return records.length;
}

function calculateTransactionVolume(records: TransactionRecord[]): number {
  return records.reduce((total, record) => total + record.volume, 0);
}
```

## Total Value Locked (TVL)

### What is TVL?

<Callout type="default">
  TVL represents the total value of assets staked or locked in a project's smart contracts.
</Callout>

#### TVL Composition
- Staked tokens
- Liquidity pool contributions
- Locked assets
- Yield-generating positions

### Importance for Project Success

- Reflects user confidence in the project
- Ensures smooth financial operations
- Signals project stability to potential investors

### TVL Calculation Method

```typescript
interface Asset {
  token: string;
  amount: number;
  price: number;
}

function calculateTVL(assets: Asset[]): number {
  return assets.reduce((total, asset) => 
    total + (asset.amount * asset.price), 
    0
  );
}
```

## Integrated Metrics Strategy

<Callout type="warning">
  These metrics are interconnected and provide a holistic view of project performance
</Callout>

### Correlation between Metrics

1. High DAU often leads to increased TRX
2. More transactions can drive TVL growth
3. Increased TVL attracts more users

## Quest Design Using Metrics

Founders can create targeted quests:
- DAU Quest: Daily interaction challenges
- TRX Quest: Transaction volume incentives
- TVL Quest: Staking and liquidity provision rewards

## Tools and Analytics

- Real-time dashboard tracking
- Historical performance graphs
- Comparative project insights
- Predictive analytics

<Callout type="success">
  Mastering these metrics empowers founders to build thriving, user-centric blockchain projects!
</Callout>

## Next Steps

1. Implement metric tracking
2. Design engagement quests
3. Analyze and iterate
