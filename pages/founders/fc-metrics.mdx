# Understanding Key Metrics

<Callout type="info">
  Master key performance indicators to build successful blockchain projects.
</Callout>

## Important Note on Points

<Callout type="warning">
  **All points are subject to change and are here for demonstration purposes only. The initial founders that applied between April 30th - December 7th had applied for the 10,000,000 points. All point/reward ratios will be announced and updated post mainnet launch.**
</Callout>

## Important Metrics

### Daily Active Users (DAU)

- Measures user engagement.
- Indicates platform stickiness.

**Strategies to Improve DAU:**

- Create daily quests or challenges.
- Implement rewards for consistent use.

### Transaction Count (TRX)

- Reflects network activity.
- High TRX can signal platform utility.

**Strategies to Increase TRX:**

- Incentivize frequent transactions.
- Lower transaction fees to encourage use.

### Total Value Locked (TVL)

- Represents the total assets staked or locked.
- Indicates trust and confidence in the platform.

**Strategies to Boost TVL:**

- Offer attractive staking rewards.
- Ensure security to build user trust.

## Points and Rewards System

<Callout type="warning">
  Transparent point allocation and reward mechanism.
  
  **Note:** All points are subject to change and are here for demonstration purposes only. The initial founders that applied between April 30th - December 7th had applied for the 10,000,000 points. All point/reward ratios will be announced and updated post mainnet launch.
</Callout>

- **Applying Points to Metrics:**
  - Use points to encourage behaviors that improve DAU, TRX, and TVL.
  - Design quests that align with your project's goals.

- **Example Integrations:**
  - **DAU Quests:** Reward daily logins or interactions.
  - **TRX Quests:** Offer points for completing transactions.
  - **TVL Quests:** Assign points for staking or providing liquidity.

**Note:** Specific point amounts are determined by the founder's strategy and are used here as examples.

## Integrated Metrics Strategy

- **Correlation between Metrics:**
  1. Increasing DAU can lead to higher TRX.
  2. More transactions may contribute to a higher TVL.
  3. A higher TVL can attract more users, enhancing DAU.

## Tools and Analytics

- Real-time dashboard tracking.
- Historical performance graphs.
- Predictive analytics.

**Additional Resources:**

- [Analytics Pipeline Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n03nt6gkl7V1ZyuVktSs8DCvydlgVtIpzNuQTRkA2k8/edit)
