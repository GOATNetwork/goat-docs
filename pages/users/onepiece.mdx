GOAT Network is a blockchain network built on Bitcoin, and the GOAT One Piece Project is an intergalactic exploration activity launched on GOAT Network. It offers a rich cross-dApp interactive experience and takes users into an ecosystem full of exploration and achievement. In GOAT One Piece, users can mint their exclusive free NFTs to obtain their own Capsule (which will be the core element for subsequent exploration activities). Additionally, users can participate in phase-based events, invite friends, and more, to earn BTC rewards and GOAT points, while increasing their rankings and contributions.
