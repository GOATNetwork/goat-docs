# One Piece Season 4 User Guide

**Last update:** Nov 17, 2025

## Overview

Season 4 is **trade-driven** and **consume-to-count**. You **earn Points** by trading and providing liquidity on [**GOATUP.io**](http://GOATUP.io), and by trading the **GOATED token on [OKU.trade](http://OKU.trade)**; then you **spend Points in the GOAT Lucky Draw**. Season 4 airdrops are computed as a weighted composite of Points from Lucky Draw consumption, GOATUP (perps/LP), OKU (GOATED spot trading), and Bridge; exact weights and eligibility follow the campaign configuration.

**Bridge** assets from **Bitcoin / BNB Smart Chain / Ethereum** into **GOAT Network using [bridge.goat.network](http://bridge.goat.network)**, use **GOATUP** to generate Points (TVL time, notional volume, realized net profit) and **OKU** to generate Points from **GOATED spot trading**, then consume Points in **Lucky Draw** and claim airdrops periodically on the **Dashboard at [airdrops.goat.network](http://airdrops.goat.network)**.

### 1. Featured dApps this season

[**Bridge**](http://bridge.goat.network) — Move assets from BTC / BNB Network to GOAT Network.  
[**GOATUP**](http://GOATUP.io) **(Perps & LP)** —

- [**Perps**](http://GOATUP.io)**:** Trade using BTC as collateral; generate **volume** and **realized net profit**.  
- [**LP**](https://dapp.goatup.io/#/pools)**:** Provide liquidity; accrue **USD·hours**.

[**OKU**](http://Oku.trade) **—** GOATED Spot — Trade GOATED on OKU; earn Points from GOATED volume (see rules below).  
[**Lucky Draw**](https://onepiece.goat.network/lucky-draw) — Spend Points for prizes; **consumption contributes to the weighted airdrop score.**

### 2. How to Participate

1. **Connect wallet** and switch to **GOAT Network** at [https://onepiece.goat.network](https://onepiece.goat.network).  
2. **Bridge assets** from Bitcoin / BNB Smart Chain at [bridge.goat.network](http://bridge.goat.network) (see table below).  
3. **Earn Points**  
   - **Use GOATUP** to earn Points (trade perps and/or provide LP).  
   - On **OKU**: trade **GOATED**.  
4. **Spend Points in Lucky Draw** (200 Points = 1 draw; daily rules below).  
5. **Claim airdrops** on the **Dashboard** during the claim windows.

### 3. What counts for the airdrop?

| Item | Counts? | Counts for the community airdrop? |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Points earned from GOATUP (LP USD·hours / notional volume / realized net profit) | **✅ Yes** | Yes — counted via Season 4’s weighted model. |
| Points earned from OKU (GOATED spot volume, after daily threshold) | **✅ Yes** | Yes — counted via Season 4’s weighted model. |
| Points earned from Bridge (eligible assets/chains) | ✅ Yes | Yes — counted via Season 4’s weighted model. |
| Points consumed in Lucky Draw | ✅ Yes | Yes — included as one weighted component. |
| Unspent Points carried over | ❌ No | No — not counted unless spent or scored by eligible actions. |
| Prizes won (BTC / GOATED / USDT / Points) | ❌ No | Tokens are credited immediately; any won Points must be consumed or otherwise qualified to count. |

**🚨 Notes**

1. Season 4 airdrops are computed as a weighted composite of: Lucky Draw consumption + GOATUP + OKU + Bridge (weights per campaign config).  
2. Daily Lucky Draw unlock: complete ≥1 GOATED trade on OKU today.  
3. Bridge minimums: BTC ≥ 0.0001, BTCB ≥ 0.0001, GOATED ≥ 50, DOGEB (DOGED) ≥ 50.

## Season 4 dApps

### 1. OKU —— GOATED Spot (new)

**Key notes**

- **Daily threshold:** Scoring points starts only after your **daily cumulative volume ≥ 1 GOATED**.  
- **Points formula:** **1 GOATED = 0.26 Points** (once the threshold is met, the **day’s entire GOATED volume** is scored).

### 2. Lucky Draw

 **Lucky Draw is One Piece’s native game loop** designed for instant feedback and ongoing engagement. You **earn Points** by doing on-chain actions (bridge, trade perps, provide LP), then **spend Points** to enter Lucky Draw and win **BTC, GOATED, USDT, Points**, and more. Only **Points you consume in Lucky Draw** count toward the **Season 4 community airdrop**. For the BTC, GOAT, and USDT rewards will be distributed to users’ wallets directly.

**Key notes**

- **Unlock each day:** complete **at least 1 GOATED trade on OKU daily** (bridge/trade/LP) to enable today’s draws.  
- **Cost:** **200 Points = 1 draw**; **cap:** **100 draws/account/day**.  
- **Re-spendable:** Points you win can be used again the same day.  
- **Fair & transparent:** results use verifiable logic with anti-abuse protections.  
- **Roadmap:** upcoming **NFT piece** draw mode, streak bonuses, and themed prize pools.

#### Lucky Draw — Quick How-to

1. **Entry & Basic Info**  
   1. Open One Piece → Lucky Draw. The banner shows “Lucky Draw box refresh every 24h.”  
   2. In Basic Info, check:  
      1. Remaining Points – your available Points and available draws (= Points / 200).  
      2. Consumed Points – total Points you’ve spent this season.  
      3. Max Draws Per Day & Remaining Today – today’s cap and remaining quota (UTC based).  

2. **Daily Eligibility**  
   1. You must complete **≥ 1 GOATED trade on OKU today** to unlock drawing.  
   2. When qualified it shows **1/1** with a green check. If not, a guide button appears—finish the trade, then return to draw.

   </p>

3. **Choose Draw Count**  
   1. Select Points (NFT Pieces coming soon).  
   2. Use – / + or the input to set draws (e.g., 10).  
   3. Points Cost auto-calculates (e.g., 2000 Points); Remaining Today updates accordingly.  
   4. If Points are insufficient or you exceed today’s cap, the button is disabled.

   2. Rewards include BTC / GOATED / USDT / Points.  
      1. BTC/GOATED/USDT prizes are sent directly to your wallet.  
      2. Points prizes return to your Remaining Points and can be used again the same day (still counted when consumed).  

5. **Results & Share**  
   A result tray pops up after the draw:

   1. Shows all rewards obtained.  
   2. Displays Total Draws 10 (example) and a **Share on X** button.

   </p>

6. **Scoring & Airdrop Policy**  
   1. Consumed Points are recorded in **Consumed Points**.  
   2. Lucky Draw consumption + GOATUP (LP USD·hours / notional volume / realized net profit) + OKU (GOATED volume, scored after the daily threshold) + Bridge are combined with weights to form your **Season 4 Airdrop Score**.  

7. **Common States & Tips**  
   1. **Not eligible:** Complete ≥ 1 GOATED trade on OKU today before drawing.  
   2. **Insufficient Points:** Use Bridge / trade / provide LP to earn Points, or reduce the draw count.  
   3. **Daily cap:** After reaching **Max Draws Per Day**, wait for the next UTC day to reset.  
   4. **Failure rollback:** If a chain error occurs, deducted Points are auto-refunded to your balance (contact in-app support if needed).

### 3. GOATUP

 GOATUP is the core trading & liquidity venue on GOAT Network. Trade BTC perps and/or provide liquidity to continuously earn Points. Your GOATUP Points (LP USD·hours, notional volume, realized net profit) contribute to the **weighted Season 4 airdrop score**.

**Key notes**

- **Perps – Notional volume:** **5 Points per $1** traded (**both buy & sell**, not netted).  
- **Perps – Realized net profit:** **10 Points per $1** profit (**settled only**, after fees & funding).  
- **LP – TVL time:** **1 USD·hour = 0.1 Points** (accrues hourly; stops when you exit).  
- **Collateral:** Trade perps with **BTC** as collateral.  
- **Tracking:** Check **Points** and **Dashboard** to see accruals and PnL.  
- **Airdrop:** All GOATUP Points feed the **weighted composite** for Season 4 airdrops.

#### GOATUP — Quick How-to

1. **Long BTC (Perps)**  
   1. Trade → BTC-USD → Long → Market: Use the right panel and select *Long / Market*.  
   2. **Pay & Collateral:** Enter the **Pay** amount (BTC as collateral). Keep the token as **BTC**. If funds are low, follow the prompt to **Bridge**.  
   3. **Leverage:** Set leverage with the slider (e.g., **7.0x**). Check **Pos.Size / Available Size**.

      <p align="center">
        <img src="/img/user-guides/goat-one-piece/image4.png" alt="GOATUP perps position setup" />
      </p>

   4. *(Optional)* **TP/SL:** Toggle **Take Profit / Stop Loss**; fill **TP Price / SL Price** or use the % presets.  
   5. Place the order: Click **Long BTC** → review the confirm modal (Leverage, Allowed Slippage, TP/SL, Entry/Liq. Price, Collateral) → **Long**.

      <p align="center">
        <img src="/img/user-guides/goat-one-piece/image5.png" alt="GOATUP perps confirmation modal" />
      </p>

   6. Monitor position & Points  
      1. Track it in **Positions** (Size, Collateral, Entry Price, Mark Price, PnL/ROE%).  
      2. Adjust via **Close / TP/SL** as needed.  
         **Scoring:** notional volume = **5 Points per $1** (both sides, not netted); realized net profit = **10 Points per $1** (settled, after fees/funding). Both feed your **weighted airdrop score**.

      <p align="center">
        <img src="/img/user-guides/goat-one-piece/image6.png" alt="GOATUP positions and PnL" />
      </p>

   7. **Tip:** Ensure BTC is bridged to GOAT first (min **0.0001 BTC**). If you see **Insufficient BTC balance**, top up via Bridge.

2. **Add Liquidity (LP)**  
   1. Pools → GPLP (or GTLP): Open Pools and pick a pool (screens show GPLP).  
   2. Enter amount: In Add Liquidity, input **Pay** amount (BTC). Quick buttons 25% / 50% / 75% / 100% are available.

      <p align="center">
        <img src="/img/user-guides/goat-one-piece/image7.png" alt="GOATUP add liquidity screen" />
      </p>

   3. Confirm: Click **Add Liquidity** and confirm. You’ll receive GPLP.  
   4. Cooldown & withdraw: You can withdraw anytime after a 15-minute cooldown.  
   5. Track yield & Points:  
      1. See **7 Days Est.APR** and **LP Fees Revenue** on Pools.  
      2. See your **Your Liquidity / PnL / APR** under **Dashboard → Pools**.  
      3. **Scoring:** 1 USD·hour = 0.1 Points. Accrual stops when you exit; earned Points remain.

      <p align="center">

      </p>

   6. One-liner: TVL (USD·hours), notional volume, realized net profit, plus OKU GOATED volume and Bridge all feed the weighted airdrop score.

#### GOATUP — Score Rules

| Action | Points formula | Notes | Example |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Provide Liquidity** | **0.1 Points/hour** | Accrues hourly; stops when you exit | $1k × 24h = 2,400 Pt |
| **Trade BTC or GOATED** | **5 Points/ $ traded** | **Both buy & sell**, not netted | **$200 trade = 1,000 Pt** |
| **Get realized profit** | **10 Points/ $ profit** | **Settled only**; **after fees & funding** | **$50 profit = 500 Pt** |

One-liner: **TVL, notional volume, realized net profit, OKU GOATED volume, and Bridge all feed the *weighted airdrop score*.**

### 4. Bridge — supported networks & minimum amounts

 The GOAT Bridge **is the gateway to GOAT Network.** It moves your assets from **Bitcoin / BNB Smart Chain / Ethereum** onto GOAT so you can join **all One Piece activities**. We currently support two routes: the **Official Bridge** and the **Stargate Bridge**. After bridging, you can trade on GOATUP, trade GOATED on OKU, provide LP, join Lucky Draw, and participate across the ecosystem.

**Key notes**

- **Routes:** Official Bridge · **Stargate Bridge**.  
- **From chains:** **Bitcoin / BNB Smart Chain / Ethereum → GOAT Network**.  
- **Assets:** BTC, BTCB, GOATED, DOGEB (see mins in the rules table).  
- **Tips:** confirmations and fees vary by chain; during campaigns, **larger bridged amounts** may earn **more Points** (check the banner/rules).

**From:** **Bitcoin / BNB Smart Chain / Ethereum** → **GOAT Network**

| Asset | From Chain | Supported bridge | Minimum bridge amount (recommended threshold) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| BTC | Bitcoin Network | https://bridge.goat.network/bridge | ≥ 0.0001 BTC |
| BTCB | BNB Network | https://bridge.goat.network/bridge?from=bsc&to=goat&asset=btcb | ≥ 0.0001 BTCB |
| GOATED | BNB Network, Ethereum Network | [https://bridge.goat.network/bridge?from=bsc&to=goat&asset=goated](https://bridge.goat.network/bridge?from=bsc&to=goat&asset=goated) | ≥ 50 GOATED |
| DOGEB | BNB Network | https://bridge.goat.network/bridge?from=bsc&to=goat&asset=dogeb | ≥ 50 DOGED |

*Tip: When campaign multipliers are active, **larger bridged amounts** can yield **more Points** (see event banners).*

## FAQ

**Q1: Will I get the community airdrop if I only earn Points but don’t draw?**  
No. **Yes, partially.** Season 4 uses a **weighted composite**. Lucky Draw **consumption** is one component; **GOATUP, OKU, and Bridge** components also contribute per configured weights.

**Q2: Why must I trade GOATED on OKU to unlock Lucky Draw?**  
To emphasize real GOATED trading activity this season.

**Q3: Can Points I win from Lucky Draw be used for more draws?**  
Yes. Won Points go to your balance and **count once you spend them again**.

**Q4: How is “realized net profit” on GOATUP calculated?**  
By settled net profit after fees & funding, scored as 1 USD = 10 Points.

**Q5: What’s the recommended sequence to start?**  
Bridge → trade/LP on GOATUP and trade GOATED on OKU to earn Points → unlock today’s Lucky Draw → spend Points → claim periodically on the Dashboard.

**Q6: When does the daily draw cap reset?**  
It resets daily according to the server time shown in the UI (see the timer next to the counter).

**Q7: Which networks/assets are supported for bridging? Minimum amounts?**  
From: Bitcoin / BNB Smart Chain / Ethereum → GOAT Network.  
Minimums: BTC 0.0001, BTCB 0.0001, GOATED 50, DOGEB 50.

**Q8: Is notional volume netted? Do both sides count?**  
Not netted. It’s absolute notional and both buy & sell count.

**Q9: How does LP scoring accrue? What if I exit?**  
By **USD·hours**: **1 USD·hour = 0.1 Points**. Accrual **stops** when you exit; earned Points remain in your balance.

**Q10: When will Points appear on the Dashboard?**  
Typically within **a few minutes**. If confirmations/cache delay, **refresh** or check again shortly.

**Q11: What’s the difference between “Remaining Points” and “Consumed Points”?**

- **Remaining Points:** Your available Points balance from all sources (GOATUP/OKU/Bridge/Lucky Draw wins) **not yet spent**.  
- **Consumed Points:** Points **spent in Lucky Draw** (one of the weighted components).

**Q12: Can unspent Points be carried forward?**  
They can be used later **within the season**, but **unspent Points don’t count** toward the Season 4 community airdrop.

**Q13: What if a draw or a trade fails?**  
Failed transactions **won’t** deduct Points. If a draw errors out, the system will **rollback/refund** to your Points balance (contact support in-app if needed).

**Q14: Is Lucky Draw fair and transparent?**  
Draws use provable on-chain/randomized logic; spend/results are traceable, with anti-cheat protections.

**Q15: Can I use multiple addresses?**  
We recommend using one address for clarity and smooth claiming. Multiple addresses may split Points and complicate claiming. Follow the rules to avoid risk controls.

**Q16: Which assets can be used as perps collateral?**  
BTC is supported as collateral; additional assets are as shown in the GOATUP UI (may expand over time).
