## 2. BTC Bridge(Bitcoin↔GOAT Network)

### 2.1 Asset Statement

The BTC assets bridged from Bitcoin mainnet to GOAT Network can be used as gas fees on GOAT network.

### 2.2 Connect Wallet

You need to connect two wallets: one BTC wallet and one EVM wallet. One will serve as the sending address, and the other as the receiving address. For security reasons, we recommend users set up the receiving address by connecting their wallet, preventing potential errors in asset transfers. However, we also support custom receiving addresses, allowing users to configure them based on their needs.

1. **Connect BTC Wallet:** We support **Unisat**, **OKX**, **Phantom**, **Bitget**, and **OneKey**.  
   <p align="center"> <img src="/img/user-guides/goat-network-bridge/pic1.png"/> </p>
2. **Connect EVM Wallet:** We support **MetaMask**, **OKX**, **Bitget**, **imToken**, **Coinbase**, **OneKey**, and **WalletConnect**.  
   <p align="center"> <img src="/img/user-guides/goat-network-bridge/pic2.png"/> </p>
3. [**Particle Wallet**](https://developers.particle.network/landing/wallet-abstraction/btc-connect)**:** If your connected BTC wallet is **Unisat**, **OKX**, or **Bitget**, Particle will create an AA wallet (EVM address) for you to use as your GOAT Network wallet. You can choose whether or not to use it. The Particle wallet entry is located at the bottom right of the page, and you can send tokens and receipt tokens within the wallet.

   <p align="center"> <img src="/img/user-guides/goat-network-bridge/pic4.png"/> </p>
   BTC Connect enables AA on Bitcoin by unifying users’ Bitcoin accounts and EVM-based smart accounts. It assigns a Bitcoin wallet as a Signer for a smart account on a Bitcoin L2 or EVM network, making users’ Bitcoin wallets the sole point of interaction with L2s, without additional interactions or interfaces.

⚠️ **Important:** The amount must exceed **0.0001 BTC** to avoid the transaction being treated as dust.
   * From an Exchange:  
      First, select BTC on the Bitcoin mainnet.  
      Second, use the provided BTC bridge-in address as the recipient address.  
   * From a Wallet:  
      First, ensure that the wallet supports the Bitcoin mainnet.  
      Second, confirm that the asset being transferred is BTC on the Bitcoin mainnet.

1. **Transaction Status**: Each transaction's current status will be updated in real-time.  
2. **Transaction ID**: Use the transaction ID to directly connect to the blockchain explorer, allowing you to view on-chain data.  
3. **Cancel Transaction**: For BTC bridge-out transactions from GOAT Network to the Bitcoin chain, you can cancel the transaction before it is broadcasted to the blockchain.  
4. **Increase Base Rate**: For BTC bridge-in transactions from the Bitcoin chain to GOAT Network, you can increase the base fee to accelerate the transaction speed.

## 7. Important Notes

1. **How to obtain gas fees on GOAT Network?**  
   The native gas token of GOAT Network is BTC. Please bridge a small amount of BTC from the BTC mainnet to GOAT Network, such as 0.0005 BTC. Please note that **BTCB bridged from the BNB Chain cannot be used to pay gas fees** on GOAT Network.  

2. **The gas fee on GOAT Network is too high. How can I fix this issue?**  
   Please manually set the network fee in your wallet. It is recommended to set the **Max Base Fee** to **\[0.005000007\]**, the **Priority Fee** to **\[0.005\]**, and check the option \[Save these values as the default for GOAT Network\] before saving the data. Please refer to the following example:  
   * **MetaMask**  
     * Edit the network fee in your wallet.  
     * Select \[Advanced\] mode.  
     * Set the Max base fee to **\[0.005000007\]** and the Priority fee to **\[0.005\]**, and read and check **\[Save these values as default for GOAT Network.\]**  
     * Finally, click **\[Save\]**, and you won't need to set the gas fee again in the future.

   <p align="center"> <img src="/img/user-guides/goat-network-bridge/pic8.png"/> </p>

     

   * **OKX**  
     * Edit the network fee in your wallet.  
     * Set the Max base fee to **\[0.005000007\]** and the Priority fee to **\[0.005\]**, and read and check **\[Save these values as default for GOAT Network.\]**  
     * Finally, click **\[Confirm\]**, and you won't need to set the gas fee again in the future.

   <p align="center"> <img src="/img/user-guides/goat-network-bridge/pic8.png"/> </p>

3. **Wallet Usage:**

   * **OneKey**

      You can use both OneKey software and hardware wallets for transactions. Please note the BTC address types supported by OneKey wallets:

     * Software Wallet: **p2wpkh (Native Segwit)**, **p2tr (Taproot)**  
     * Hardware Wallet: **Pro**, **Classic1S**, **p2tr (Taproot)**  
     * For more details about OneKey wallets, please refer to the [official documentation](https://developer.onekey.so/connect-to-software/webapp-connect-onekey/btc/api-reference/signpsbt).

   * **Ledger**

     If you want to use this wallet, it is recommended to connect the BTC wallet to OKX and the EVM wallet to MetaMask.

   * **Keystone**

     If you want to use this wallet, it is recommended to connect the BTC wallet to Unisat and the EVM wallet to MetaMask.

4. **Fees:**

   * Cross-chain transfers may require the following fees:  
     * **Gas Fee**: Transaction fee on the source chain.  
     * **Bridge Fee**: For BTC, you only need to pay a service fee of 0.1% of the amount being bridged out and the gas fee for the first layer network. For DOGE and BTCB, every cross-chain operation requires a cross-chain service fee paid to **LayerZero**.  
   * Fees are dynamically adjusted based on the blockchain network status.  
5. **Transfer Amount Limit:**

   * Each asset has a minimum transfer amount limit. Ensure your transaction amount exceeds the minimum required.  
   * The BTC transfer amount cannot include more than 200 UTXOs and must be below the indicated value. Other assets have no maximum amount limit.  
6. **Supported Assets and Networks:**

   * The cross-chain bridge supports only the listed assets and blockchains. More networks and assets will be supported in the future.  
7. **Double-Check Addresses:**

   * Carefully check the target chain address when entering it. An incorrect address will result in **permanent loss of assets**.  
8. **Network Delays:**

   * If the transaction takes longer to process, please be patient. Do not resubmit the transaction to avoid the risk of asset loss.

## 8. Security Tips

1. Always access the cross-chain bridge through official channels. Avoid clicking on unknown links or phishing websites.  
2. Never disclose your seed phrase, private key, or wallet password.  
3. Ensure your wallet and devices are protected from malware.
