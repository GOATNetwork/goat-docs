## About Gas

**Understanding Gas on GOAT Network**

GOAT Network uses **BTC** as its native token for gas. This means you'll pay transaction fees in BTC. 
It uses an 18-decimal precision, unlike Bitcoin's 8-decimal precision.

**Obtaining gas**:

* You can obtain gas by bridging BTC from Bitcoin Layer 1 into GOAT Network using the [GOAT Bridge](https://bridge.goat.network).  
* Airdrop of BTC gas from Faucet will be granted for bridging in more than $50 worth of either BTC (from Bitcoin Layer 1), BTCB (from BNB Chain), or DOGE via the official bridge, or for bridging in WETH, USDT, or USDC.e, via the Stargate bridge.
* Please note that <font color="red">BTCB cannot be used as gas </font> within the GOAT Network – only BTC from Bitcoin Layer 1 can.


To optimize your transaction costs, review your wallet’s gas fee settings carefully. Using incorrect or unnecessarily high gas fees can lead to overpayment.


**Saving GAS by using advanced gas mode**

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Please read the following instructions carefully to avoid overpaying for gas, it's crucial to check and adjust your wallet's gas settings before confirming transactions. Here's how to do it in MetaMask (the process may be slightly different for other wallets):
</Callout>


1. Review gas fees

On the transaction confirmation page, locate the `Network fee` field and click the `Edit` button.

2. Modify gas settings
In the `Edit gas fee` window, choose the `Advanced` tab.

<p align="center"> <img src="/img/user-guides/2.png" width="300"/> </p>

3. Enter custom values

**Max Base Fee (GWEI)**: 0.000200007
**Priority Fee (GWEI)**: 0.0001

<p align="center"> <img src="/img/user-guides/3.png" width="300"/> </p>

4. Save defaults
Check `Save these values as my default for GOAT Network` so that your future transactions follow these optimized settings.

5. Save
Click `Save` to apply the settings.

## Understanding Fee Calculation

GOAT Network uses [EIP-1559](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/) for gas-efficient transactions, the formula for total transaction fees is as follows:
Total Fee = Gas Used × (Base Fee + Priority Fee)

**Example Calculation (ERC-20 Transfer)**
Let's say you're sending an ERC-20 token, and the transaction uses 21,000 gas units (a typical value for a simple transfer). Using the recommended Priority Fee of 0.0001 Gwei and the provided Max Base Fee of 0.000200007 Gwei.

**Estimated Maximum Gas Costs** = Gas Limit * (Max Base Fee + Priority Fee) = 21,000 * (0.000200007 + 0.0001) = 0.000006300147 BTC
In times of low network congestion, the actual base fee consumed may be as low as 0.000000007, you’ll pay is as follows:
Typical Gas Costs = Gas Limit * (Base Fee + Priority Fee) = 21,000 * (0.000200007 + 0.0001) = 0.000000002100147 BTC

**Important Considerations**
Network congestion: When the network is busy, gas prices may increase. Check your gas settings before confirming any transaction.
