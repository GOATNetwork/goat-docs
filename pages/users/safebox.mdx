## Overview

We all know that people are currently cautious about investing directly in Bitcoin. The [Safebox](https://safebox.goat.network/) product was created to address concerns about the security of Bitcoin investments. Users simply deposit BTC into Safebox, and we will return an equivalent amount of UTXO with a Timelock to the user's BTC wallet. Once the Timelock expires, users can spend the UTXO. During the lock period, users can also earn BTC profits. This solution cleverly uses Timelocked UTXO to keep users' BTC assets in their own wallets, eliminating worries about losing the principal.

## How to Obtain a Locking Order

1. Become a **Partner** through [the application link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScygx6iR-o1Bg5sL6iqGEPOXkkx613Mu5fD0CXnGHHxVIOr3A/viewform).  
2. After receiving your application, we will proactively contact you.  
3. If you decide to lock BTC, please provide the following information so we can create a valid locking order in the contract.

| Info | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| Locking Amount | The amount of BTC you want to lock, which must be greater than 0.0005 BTC. |
| Deadline | The deadline for locking the order; the expired order will be invalidated. |
| Public Key | The public key of the receiving wallet for the UTXO with Timelock. After the unlock time, only the private key corresponding to this public key (specifically for this wallet) can spend the UTXO. |
| Receiving Address | The receiving address for spending the UTXO after it is unlocked. Note that **the receiving address must match the receiving wallet’s public key**, and currently, only **Native Segwit (P2WPKH)** address types are supported. |

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Partner ID** is your unique account identifier. Please keep it safe.  
2. Once the bridge-in transaction is submitted, **please do not resubmit,** as this may cause your funds to be transferred to the GOAT Network, requiring a manual refund process.  
3. When bridging in via script, make sure the **amount and deposit address** exactly match the order. Any discrepancy may result in funds being bridged to the GOAT Network and requiring a refund process.  
4. If more than **2 hours has passed** since the bridge-in and no transaction record appears on the frontend, the delay might be caused by **network congestion** on Bitcoin mainnet. If you're concerned, please contact your account manager for assistance.
