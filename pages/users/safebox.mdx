## GOAT Safebox User guide

We all know that people are currently cautious about investing directly in Bitcoin. The [Safebox](https://safebox.goat.network/) product was created to address concerns about the security of Bitcoin investments. 
1. Users simply transfer BTC into Safebox, and we will return a UTXO of equivalent value with a 90-day timelock to the user’s BTC wallet.
2. Once the timelock expires, users can spend the UTXO. During the lock period, users can earn BTC at a 1.5% yield. 

This solution cleverly uses Timelocked UTXO to keep users' BTC in their own wallets, eliminating worries about losing the principal.

## How to Obtain a Locking Order

1. Safebox is a whitelist-only product. Please apply for **the whitelist access ID** through [the application link](https://forms.gle/aoWrh3aTXUP2dWGN8).  
2. After receiving your application, we will proactively contact you.  
3. If you decide to lock BTC, please provide the following information so we can create a valid locking order in the contract.

| Info | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| Locking Amount | Locked amount per round. For each round, each account must lock at least 1 BTC. The amount may be split across multiple transactions, each ≥ 0.01 BTC. |
| Receiving Address | The receiving address for spending the UTXO after it is unlocked. Note that **the receiving address must match the receiving wallet’s public key**, and currently, only **Native Segwit (P2WPKH)** address types are supported. |
| Public Key | The public key of the receiving wallet for the UTXO with Timelock. After the unlock time, only the private key corresponding to this public key (specifically for this wallet) can spend the UTXO. || Receiving Address | The receiving address for spending the UTXO after it is unlocked. Note that **the receiving address must match the receiving wallet’s public key**, and currently, only **Native Segwit (P2WPKH)** address types are supported. |

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Access ID** is your unique account identifier. Please keep it safe.  
2. Once the order is created, please complete the transfer within **48 hours**. Otherwise, the lock will expire and you will need to contact support for a manual refund.
3. Once the transfer transaction is submitted, **please do not resubmit**. Duplicate submissions may cause issues requiring manual intervention and refund processing.
4. If more than **2 hours have passed** since the transfer and no transaction record appears on the frontend, the delay might be caused by **network congestion** on Bitcoin mainnet. If you're concerned, please contact your account manager for assistance.
