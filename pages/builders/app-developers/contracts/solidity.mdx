# Solidity Compatibility

## Supported Solidity Versions
- 0.8.0 to 0.8.26 fully supported
- Earlier versions may have compatibility issues

## Key Differences from Ethereum

### Gas Optimizations
- Lower storage costs
- Modified precompile costs
- Batch transaction discounts
- ZK-proof verification optimizations

### Bitcoin-Specific Features
- Native BTC handling primitives
- Bitcoin script integration
- Taproot compatibility
- Multi-signature optimizations

### Available Precompiles
| Address | Name | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| 0x01 | btcVerify | Bitcoin transaction verification |
| 0x02 | zkProof | ZK proof verification |
| 0x03 | bridge | Bridge contract interface |
| 0x04 | sequencer | Sequencer interface |

## Development Considerations
1. Use Bitcoin-aware libraries
2. Implement proper fee handling
3. Consider L1/L2 interactions
4. Optimize for batch transactions

## Testing and Deployment
1. Use local development environment first
2. Test on GOAT testnet
3. Verify Bitcoin interactions
4. Monitor gas usage patterns
