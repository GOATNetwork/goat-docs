# Solidity Compatibility

GOAT Protocol is designed to be fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This means that almost all Ethereum tooling, including the Solidity smart contract language, works out of the box on GOAT Protocol. However, there are a few minor differences between GOAT Protocol and Ethereum that developers should be aware of when building Solidity contracts.

## EVM/Opcode Differences

Most smart contracts will work on GOAT Protocol without any changes. Check out the Differences Between Ethereum and GOAT Protocol page for a detailed list of the few differences you should know about.
