# App Developer Overview

Welcome to the **GOAT Network App Developer Documentation**! This guide is your starting point for developing decentralized applications (dApps) on **GOAT Network Testnet3**, a secure, efficient, and developer-friendly blockchain network.

## Why Build on GOAT Network?

The GOAT Network combines cutting-edge blockchain features with seamless Ethereum compatibility, offering a powerful platform for dApp developers. Key benefits include:

- **Ethereum Compatibility**: Fully EVM-equivalent for easy migration of Ethereum dApps.
- **Bitcoin Settlement**: Transactions leverage Bitcoin's unmatched security for settlement.
- **Gas Efficiency**: Implements **EIP-1559** for reduced gas costs, especially in batch operations.
- **High Throughput**: Optimized to process high transaction volumes with rapid confirmations.
- **Decentralized Sequencing**: Guarantees trustlessness and resistance to censorship.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your development environment and start building:

### 1. Set Up Your Development Environment

Ensure you have the following tools ready:

- **Node.js and NPM**: Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and NPM to manage dependencies.
- **Web3.js or Ethers.js**: Use your preferred Ethereum library for interacting with smart contracts.
- **GOAT Network RPC Endpoint**: `https://rpc.testnet3.goat.network`
- **Chain ID**: `48816`
- **Network Name**: `GOAT Testnet3`

### 2. Configure Your Wallet

To connect your wallet to GOAT Network Testnet3:

1. Open MetaMask and go to **Settings > Networks > Add Network**.
2. Fill in the following details:
   - **Network Name**: `GOAT Testnet3`
   - **New RPC URL**: `https://rpc.testnet3.goat.network`
   - **Chain ID**: `0xBEB0` (48816)
   - **Currency Symbol**: `BTC`
   - **Block Explorer URL**: `https://explorer.testnet3.goat.network`

### 3. Obtain Testnet Funds

Use the [GOAT Network Faucet](https://bridge.testnet3.goat.network/faucet) to get test **BTC** for deploying and testing your dApps.
