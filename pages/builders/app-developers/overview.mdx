# App Developer Overview

Welcome to the GOAT Network App Developer documentation! This guide is designed to help you start building decentralized applications (dApps) on the GOAT Network Testnet3.

## Key Features of GOAT Network

- **Ethereum Compatibility**: GOAT Network is EVM-equivalent, making it easy to port existing Ethereum dApps.
- **Bitcoin Settlement**: Transactions are settled on the Bitcoin network, leveraging its security.
- **Gas Efficiency**: Implements EIP-1155 for optimized gas usage, especially for batch operations.
- **High Throughput**: Capable of processing a large number of transactions with quick confirmation times.
- **Decentralized Sequencing**: Ensures trustlessness and censorship resistance.

## Getting Started

### 1. Set Up Your Development Environment

- **Node.js and NPM**: Ensure you have Node.js and NPM installed.
- **Web3.js or Ethers.js**: Install your preferred Ethereum library.
- **GOAT Network RPC Endpoint**: `https://rpc.testnet3.goat.network`
- **Chain ID**: `48816`
- **Network Name**: `GOAT Testnet3`

### 2. Configure Your Wallet

- **MetaMask Settings**:
  - **Network Name**: `GOAT Testnet3`
  - **New RPC URL**: `https://rpc.testnet3.goat.network`
  - **Chain ID**: `0xBEB0` (48816)
  - **Currency Symbol**: `BTC`
  - **Block Explorer URL**: `https://explorer.testnet3.goat.network`

### 3. Obtain Testnet Funds

- Use the [GOAT Network Faucet](https://faucet.testnet3.goat.network) to request test gETH.
