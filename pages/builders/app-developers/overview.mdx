# App Developer Overview

Welcome to the GOAT Network App Developer documentation! This guide is designed to help you start building decentralized applications (dApps) on the GOAT Network Testnet3.

## Key Features of GOAT Network

- **Ethereum Compatibility**: GOAT Network is EVM-equivalent, making it easy to port existing Ethereum dApps.
- **Bitcoin Settlement**: Transactions are settled on the Bitcoin network, leveraging its security.
- **Gas Efficiency**: Implements EIP-1155 for optimized gas usage, especially for batch operations.
- **High Throughput**: Capable of processing a large number of transactions with quick confirmation times.
- **Decentralized Sequencing**: Ensures trustlessness and censorship resistance.

## Getting Started

### 1. Set Up Your Development Environment

- **Node.js and NPM**: Ensure you have Node.js and NPM installed.
- **Web3.js or Ethers.js**: Install your preferred Ethereum library.
- **GOAT Network RPC Endpoint**:

  ```bash
  https://rpc.testnet3.goat.network
  ```

### 2. Configure Your Wallet

- **MetaMask**:

  - Add a custom network with the following parameters:
    - **Network Name**: GOAT Network Testnet3
    - **New RPC URL**: `https://rpc.testnet3.goat.network`
    - **Chain ID**: `48816`
    - **Currency Symbol**: `gETH`
    - **Block Explorer URL**: `https://explorer.testnet3.goat.network`

### 3. Obtain Testnet Funds

- Use the [GOAT Network Faucet](https://faucet.testnet3.goat.network) to request test gETH.

## Development Resources

### Documentation

- [Technical Whitepaper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U-thxS4DRfSTOsLxC2ezQNk1KNrrLBd3/view)
- [Smart Contract Guide](./contracts/solidity)
- [GOAT Network Explorer](https://explorer.testnet3.goat.network)

### SDKs and Tools

- **GOAT Network SDK**: Coming soon.
- **Truffle**: For smart contract development.
- **Hardhat**: For advanced testing and deployment.

## Smart Contract Development

- **Solidity Support**: Full support for Solidity smart contracts.
- **Vyper Support**: Compatibility with Vyper is experimental.
- **Deployment**: Contracts can be deployed using standard Ethereum tools like Truffle and Hardhat.

## Important Considerations

- **Testing on Testnet3**: Always test your contracts thoroughly on Testnet3 before considering mainnet deployment.
- **Gas Optimization**: Leverage EIP-1155 features for gas-efficient operations.
- **Security**: Follow best practices for smart contract security.
