# App Developer Overview
Developing on GOAT Network is not much different from developing on any other EVM equivelant layer 2. In this section, you'll find everything you need to get started. 


## Core Concepts
The GOAT network is unique in many ways. It is an EVM equivelant Layer 2 on Bitcoin. The GOAT Network introduces an Optimistic Challenge Protocol (GOAT-OCP) on BitVM2, combining it with ZKM Entangled Rollupâ€™s trust-minimized and universal settlement infrastructure to achieve the most decentralized and secure Bitcoin Layer 2 (L2) solution.
