# Bridging Basics
Bridging is the process of transferring assets or data from one blockchain network to another. In the context of GOAT Protocol, this typically involves moving Bitcoin (L1) assets to the GOAT network (L2) to take advantage of the latterâ€™s scalability and smart contract capabilities.

## Key Concepts
- **Peg-In:** The process of locking assets on the original chain (L1) to mint corresponding assets on the destination chain (L2).
- **Peg-Out:** The process of burning assets on the destination chain (L2) to release the corresponding assets on the original chain (L1).
- **Trustless Bridge:** A bridge that does not require trust in a central entity, relying instead on cryptographic proofs and decentralized protocols.
