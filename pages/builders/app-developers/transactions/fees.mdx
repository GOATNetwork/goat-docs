2. Ignoring L1 data availability costs
3. Insufficient fee buffer
4. Missing batch optimization opportunities

## Fee Optimization Strategies
1. Use calldata compression
2. Batch similar transactions
3. Monitor L1 congestion periods
4. Implement dynamic fee adjustment
5. Cache fee estimates for similar transactions
