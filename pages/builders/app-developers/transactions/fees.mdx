# Transaction Fees on GOAT Network

<Callout type="warning">
  This documentation refers to Testnet3. Fee structures may be adjusted for mainnet launch.
</Callout>

## Overview

GOAT Network implements a gas-efficient fee structure that leverages **EIP-1559** for optimized token operations while ensuring secure settlement on Bitcoin. This dual-layer approach allows for cost-effective batch transactions while maintaining Bitcoin's security guarantees.

Transactions on GOAT Network involve fees for both Layer 1 (Bitcoin) and Layer 2 (GOAT Network) operations.

### L2 Execution Fee (GOAT Network)

- **Purpose**: Covers the computational and storage costs of executing transactions on GOAT Network.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Benefits from EIP-1559's gas optimizations.
  - Includes costs for smart contract execution, storage operations, and state changes.
  - Gas price is determined by GOAT Network's fee market.

## Detailed Fee Structure

### Gas Price and Gas Limit

- **Gas Price**: The amount you're willing to pay per unit of gas, expressed in Gwei.
- **Gas Limit**: The maximum amount of gas units you're willing to consume for the transaction.

### Calculating Total Fee

**Total Transaction Fee** = `Gas Price` * `Gas Used`

- **Gas Used**: The actual amount of gas consumed during transaction execution.
- **Note**: For transactions involving batch operations, gas usage is significantly reduced per operation.

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

1. **Not Understanding EIP-1559 Fee Mechanics**:
   - *Impact*: Transactions may be priced inefficiently or fail due to incorrect fee estimation.
   - *Solution*: Familiarize yourself with EIP-1559's base fee and priority fee mechanics used by sequencer nodes.

2. **Insufficient Fee Buffer**:
   - *Impact*: Transactions may fail if gas estimates are too tight.
   - *Solution*: Add a percentage (5-20%) buffer to gas estimates to account for network fluctuations.

3. **Not Monitoring Network Congestion**:
   - *Impact*: Higher fees during periods of network congestion.
   - *Solution*: Monitor Layer 2 network activity and consider timing non-urgent transactions during lower congestion periods.

4. **Not Utilizing Batch Operations**:
   - *Impact*: Paying higher fees for multiple individual transactions.
   - *Solution*: Use EIP-1559 batch operations to reduce overall gas costs when performing multiple similar operations.

## Fee Optimization Strategies

1. **Use Batch Operations**:
   - **Benefit**: Reduces per-operation gas cost significantly.
   - **How**: Combine multiple token transfers or actions into a single transaction using EIP-1559's batch functions.

2. **Monitor Bitcoin Network Conditions**:
   - **Benefit**: Optimize for lower L1 fees.
   - **How**: Schedule transactions during periods of lower Bitcoin network fees. Utilize fee estimation tools.

3. **Optimize Smart Contracts**:
   - **Benefit**: Minimizes gas consumption.
   - **How**: Use efficient data structures, minimize state changes, and avoid unnecessary computations within contracts.

4. **Implement Dynamic Fee Adjustment**:
   - **Benefit**: Balances cost and transaction speed.
   - **How**: Adjust gas prices dynamically based on current network conditions within your application's logic.

5. **Cache Fee Estimates**:
   - **Benefit**: Improves performance and user experience.
   - **How**: For applications with similar transactions, cache gas estimates and update them periodically.

## Current Network Stats

- **Average Gas Price**: Variable depending on network conditions.
- **Network Utilization**: Monitor via the explorer.
- **Average Block Time**: Approximately 3.5 seconds on Testnet3.
