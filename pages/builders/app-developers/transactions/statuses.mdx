# Transaction Statuses on GOAT Network

<Callout type="warning">
  This documentation refers to Testnet3. Status definitions may be adjusted for mainnet.
</Callout>

Understanding the different transaction statuses on GOAT Network is essential for developers and users to track the progress of their transactions and handle them appropriately in applications.

## Transaction Lifecycle

Transactions on GOAT Network go through several stages before they are finalized on the Bitcoin blockchain.

### 1. Pending

- **Description**:
  - Transaction has been sent to the network but is not yet included in a block.
- **Availability**:
  - Accessible via `eth_getTransactionByHash` or by checking the pending transaction pool.
- **Developer Note**:
  - In this state, the transaction can still be replaced or canceled if using the same nonce.

### 2. Sequencer Confirmed (Unsafe)

- **Description**:
  - Transaction has been included in a block by the Sequencer on GOAT Network.
  - Block has not yet been published to Bitcoin.
- **Timeframe**: Typically within 2-4 seconds.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Quick confirmation, allowing for fast user feedback.
  - Not yet secured by Bitcoin's proof-of-work.
- **Developer Note**:
  - Display as "Pending Confirmation" to users, indicating progress.

### 3. Published to Bitcoin (Safe)

- **Description**:
  - Sequencer block containing the transaction has been published to the Bitcoin network.
- **Timeframe**: Typically within 10-60 minutes, depending on Bitcoin block times.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Transaction gains additional security from Bitcoin's blockchain.
  - Still awaiting a certain number of Bitcoin confirmations for finality.
- **Developer Note**:
  - Display as "Confirmed" but inform users that finality is pending.

### 4. Finalized

- **Description**:
  - Transaction has achieved finality on the Bitcoin blockchain after sufficient confirmations.
- **Timeframe**: Depends on the number of confirmations required (e.g., 6 confirmations could take ~1 hour).
- **Characteristics**:
  - Transaction is immutable and secured by Bitcoin's proof-of-work.
- **Developer Note**:
  - Display as "Finalized" or "Completed" to users.
  - Applications can now safely assume the transaction is permanent.

## Special Considerations

### Reorgs and Forks

- **Explanation**: While rare, reorgs on the Bitcoin blockchain can affect transactions that are not yet finalized.
- **Impact**: Transactions in the "Published to Bitcoin" state may be reversed in the event of a reorg.
- **Mitigation**: Wait for a sufficient number of confirmations before considering a transaction final.

### Transaction Failures

- **Reasons**:
  - **Insufficient Gas or Fees**: If the gas limit or fees are too low.
  - **Contract Execution Errors**: Errors within the smart contract logic.
- **Handling**:
  - Monitor the transaction status and handle failures gracefully.
  - Inform users of any issues and provide steps for resolution.

### Batch Transactions with EIP-1159

- **Atomicity**: All operations in a batch transaction are processed atomically.
- **Failure Handling**:
  - If one operation in the batch fails, the entire transaction reverts.
- **Status Application**:
  - Transaction statuses apply to the entire batch uniformly.

## Monitoring Transaction Statuses

- **Event Listeners**:
  - Use event listeners in your application to track transaction hashes and status updates.
- **RPC Methods**:
  - Utilize the GOAT Network's RPC methods:
    - `eth_getTransactionReceipt`
    - `eth_getBlockByNumber`
- **Block Explorer**:
  - Leverage the [GOAT Network Explorer](https://explorer.testnet3.goat.network) for real-time monitoring and status checks.

## Best Practices for Developers

1. **Provide Clear User Feedback**:
   - Communicate transaction status accurately at each stage.
   - Use appropriate messaging for each status to set user expectations.

2. **Implement Timeouts and Retries**:
   - Handle network delays or failures by implementing timeout logic.
   - Provide options for users to retry transactions if necessary.

3. **Handle Edge Cases**:
   - Account for possible reorgs or transaction failures in your application logic.
   - Ensure that funds and states are correctly managed in all scenarios.

4. **Test Thoroughly on Testnet3**:
   - Simulate various transaction statuses and failures to ensure your application behaves correctly.

5. **Maintain Synchronization**:
   - Keep your application's state in sync with the network to avoid discrepancies.
   - Regularly query the network for updates rather than relying solely on local states.
