# Transaction Statuses on GOAT Network

<Callout type="warning">
  This guide is based on Testnet3. Status definitions and behavior may be adjusted for mainnet deployment.
</Callout>

Understanding transaction statuses on the GOAT Network is essential for tracking progress and handling transactions effectively in your applications.

## Transaction Lifecycle

Transactions on the GOAT Network pass through several distinct stages before achieving finality on the Bitcoin blockchain. Each stage provides different levels of security and feedback for users.

### 1. Pending

- **Description**:
  - The transaction has been submitted to the network but is not yet included in a block.
- **Availability**:
  - Query the pending transaction pool using `eth_getTransactionByHash`.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Transaction can still be replaced or canceled by resubmitting with the same nonce and higher gas fees.
- **Developer Note**:
  - Display as "Pending" in the UI, with an option for users to replace or cancel the transaction.

### 2. Sequencer Confirmed (Unsafe - pending publication)

- **Description**:
  - The transaction has been included in a block by the Sequencer on the GOAT Network.
  - This block has not yet been published to the Bitcoin blockchain.
- **Timeframe**: Usually 2-4 seconds.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Provides rapid feedback to users.
  - Not secured by Bitcoin's proof-of-work.
- **Developer Note**:
  - Label this as "Sequencer Confirmed" or "Pending Confirmation" in your application.
  - Advise users to wait for publication to Bitcoin for stronger security guarantees.

### 3. Published to Bitcoin (Safe)

- **Description**:
  - The Sequencer block containing the transaction has been published to the Bitcoin blockchain.
- **Timeframe**: Typically 10-60 minutes, depending on Bitcoin block times.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Gains security from Bitcoin's blockchain but may still be affected by reorgs.
  - Finality is pending until sufficient confirmations are achieved.
- **Developer Note**:
  - Display as "Published" or "Confirmed (Pending Finality)."
  - Inform users about the current confirmation count and expected finality timeframe.

### 4. Finalized

- **Description**:
  - The transaction has achieved finality on the Bitcoin blockchain after receiving the required number of confirmations.
- **Timeframe**: Varies based on the number of confirmations (e.g., ~6 confirmations for ~1 hour).
- **Characteristics**:
  - Immutable and fully secured by Bitcoin's proof-of-work.
- **Developer Note**:
  - Display as "Finalized" or "Completed."
  - Indicate that the transaction is now permanent and irreversible.

## Special Considerations

### Reorgs and Forks

- **Explanation**:
  - Bitcoin blockchain reorganizations (reorgs) can affect transactions in the "Published to Bitcoin" state.
- **Impact**:
  - Transactions may be reversed if included in orphaned blocks.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Wait for sufficient confirmations (e.g., 6+) before treating a transaction as final.

### Transaction Failures

- **Potential Causes**:
  - **Insufficient Gas or Fees**: Transaction rejected due to low gas price or insufficient gas limit.
  - **Smart Contract Errors**: Execution errors caused by invalid inputs or logic.
- **Handling Failures**:
  - Monitor the transaction receipt for `status: false`.
  - Inform users of failure reasons and provide actionable steps to resolve issues (e.g., resubmitting with higher fees).

### Batch Transactions with EIP-1559

- **Atomicity**:
  - All operations within a batch are executed atomically. If one operation fails, the entire batch is reverted.
- **Status Application**:
  - The transaction status applies uniformly to the entire batch.
- **Developer Note**:
  - Ensure error handling accounts for full batch reverts when working with EIP-1559 batch operations.

## Monitoring Transaction Statuses

### Event Listeners

- Set up event listeners in your application to track transaction hashes and status updates in real-time.

### RPC Methods

- Utilize the following RPC methods to monitor transactions:
  - `eth_getTransactionReceipt`: Retrieve the transaction status and related information.
  - `eth_getBlockByNumber`: Check the inclusion of transactions in blocks.

### Block Explorer

- Use the [GOAT Network Explorer](https://explorer.testnet3.goat.network) for live transaction monitoring and detailed status information.

## Best Practices for Developers

1. **Communicate Status Clearly**:
   - Provide users with clear, descriptive statuses at each stage of the transaction lifecycle.
   - Include contextual information, such as estimated timeframes and security implications.

2. **Implement Timeouts and Retries**:
   - Set timeouts for pending transactions and allow users to retry if necessary.
   - Use retries cautiously to prevent nonce conflicts.

3. **Handle Reorgs Gracefully**:
   - Account for possible reorgs by monitoring confirmations and updating transaction states accordingly.

4. **Test Extensively**:
   - Simulate various transaction states and edge cases (e.g., failures, reorgs) on Testnet3 to validate application behavior.

5. **Stay Synchronized**:
   - Regularly poll the network for updates to keep your application state consistent with the blockchain.
