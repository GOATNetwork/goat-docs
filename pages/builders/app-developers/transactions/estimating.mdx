## Understanding Gas Estimation on GOAT Network

Accurately estimating transaction fees is crucial for ensuring that your transactions are processed efficiently without unexpected costs. On GOAT Network, gas estimation involves considering both L2 execution costs and L1 data availability fees.

## Steps for Estimating Fees

### 1. Estimating Gas Usage

- **Use Gas Estimation Tools**:
  - Utilize `web3.js` or `ethers.js` libraries to estimate gas.
  - Example using `web3.js`:

    ```javascript
    const estimateGasUsage = async (transaction) => {
      const gasEstimate = await web3.eth.estimateGas(transaction);
      return gasEstimate;
    };
    ```

- **Consider Batch Operations**:
  - For EIP-1559 batch operations, gas usage per operation decreases.
  - Estimate gas for batch transactions accordingly.

### 2. Determining Gas Price

- **Retrieve Current Gas Price**:
  - The gas price on GOAT Network includes L2 execution costs and an estimate of L1 data availability fees.
  - Example:

    ```javascript
    const getGasPrice = async () => {
      const gasPrice = await web3.eth.getGasPrice();
      return gasPrice;
    };
    ```

- **Monitor Network Conditions**:
  - Gas prices might vary based on network congestion on both GOAT Network and Bitcoin.

### 3. Calculating Total Fee

- **Total Fee Calculation**:

  ```javascript
  const estimateTransactionFee = async (transaction) => {
    const gasEstimate = await estimateGasUsage(transaction);
    const gasPrice = await getGasPrice();
    const totalFee = web3.utils.toBN(gasEstimate).mul(web3.utils.toBN(gasPrice));
    return totalFee;
  };
  ```

- **Add Buffer**:
  - It's recommended to add a 20% buffer to account for fluctuations.

### 4. Example Estimation

- **Estimating for a Single Token Transfer**:

  ```javascript
  const transaction = {
    from: senderAddress,
    to: tokenContractAddress,
    data: tokenContract.methods.transfer(recipientAddress, amount).encodeABI(),
  };

  const totalFee = await estimateTransactionFee(transaction);
  console.log(`Estimated Fee: ${web3.utils.fromWei(totalFee, 'ether')} ETH`);
  ```

- **Estimating for a Batch Operation**:

  ```javascript
  const transaction = {
    from: senderAddress,
    to: tokenContractAddress,
    data: tokenContract.methods.safeBatchTransferFrom(
      senderAddress,
      recipientAddress,
      tokenIds,
      amounts,
      "0x"
    ).encodeABI(),
  };

  const totalFee = await estimateTransactionFee(transaction);
  console.log(`Estimated Fee for Batch Transfer: ${web3.utils.fromWei(totalFee, 'ether')} ETH`);
  ```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Accurate Gas Estimation**:
   - Always use the latest network data for gas estimates.

2. **Monitor Bitcoin Network Fees**:
   - Higher Bitcoin fees can affect the L1 Data Availability Fee component.

3. **Implement Fee Capping**:
   - Set maximum fee thresholds to prevent overpaying during congestion.

4. **Test on Testnet3**:
   - Before deploying to mainnet, test your fee estimation logic on Testnet3.

5. **Leverage Batch Operations**:
   - Utilize EIP-1559's batch capabilities to reduce per-operation costs.
