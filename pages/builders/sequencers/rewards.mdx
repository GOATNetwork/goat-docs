# Sequencer Rewards

This guide provides detailed information about the rewards available for sequencers on the GOAT Network and how to claim them.

## Rewards

Sequencers play a pivotal role in processing and validating transactions on the GOAT Network. To acknowledge their contributions, sequencers are rewarded with mining rewards in GOAT tokens and gas rewards in BTC. These rewards are distributed with every block mined by the sequencers.

The reward distribution mechanisms are carefully designed to align with the network's economic principles, ensuring fairness and sustainability. For a detailed understanding of the reward structure and economic model, please refer to the [GOAT Network Beige Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17TDEZBe9q8eUsK68dnY4z4fbr0jQA5qG/view).

## How to Claim Rewards

Once your sequencer begins earning rewards, you can claim them using the GOAT Network Locking contract.

### Claiming Process

1. **Claim Reward**: Use the `claim` method of the **Locking** contract. Provide your validator address and the recipient address where you want the rewards to be sent.

   ```solidity:contracts/Locking.sol
   function claim(address validator, address recipient) external
   ```

2. **Receive Rewards**: The gas rewards (BTC) will be transferred to the specified recipient address.

  **Important:** Currently, sequencers can only claim BTC gas rewards. Mining rewards in GOAT tokens are recorded with each mined block but will only be distributed after the Token Generation Event (TGE). To claim any historical mining rewards in GOAT tokens after the TGE, you must use the recipient address previously specified during the claim process to call the `reclaim` method on the Locking contract.

  Ensure that your recipient address is correctly configured for the appropriate network (Alpha Mainnet or Testnet3) to avoid issues during the claiming process.
