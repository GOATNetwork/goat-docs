# Sequencing Rewards

<Callout type="warning">
  **Notice:** The rewards for sequencers are currently being updated. The GOAT Network Dashboard is under active development and has not yet been deployed.

This guide provides information on the rewards for being a sequencer on the GOAT Network and how to claim them.

## Rewards

Sequencers play a crucial role in processing and validating transactions on the GOAT Network. In recognition of their contributions, sequencers are rewarded with GOAT tokens. The rewards are distributed on each block mined by the sequencer.

The reward distribution mechanisms are designed to align with the network's economic principles, promoting fairness and sustainability. For a comprehensive understanding of the reward structure and economic model, please refer to the [GOAT Network Economics Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17TDEZBe9q8eUsK68dnY4z4fbr0jQA5qG/view).

### Reward Structure

| Network      | Reward per Block                    | Distribution Frequency |
|--------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Alpha Mainnet** | `X GOAT` per block                  | Every 10 seconds       |
| **Testnet3**      | `Y GOAT` per block                  | Every 15 seconds       |

> **Note:** `X` and `Y` represent the respective reward amounts for Alpha Mainnet and Testnet3. These values are subject to change based on network governance.

## How to Claim Rewards

Once your sequencer starts earning rewards, you will be able to claim them through the GOAT Network Dashboard. However, the dashboard is currently under development. Please stay tuned for updates on its deployment.

### Claiming Process

1. **Access Dashboard**: Navigate to the GOAT Network Dashboard once it's available.
2. **Connect Wallet**: Connect your whitelisted wallet to the dashboard.
3. **Request Withdrawal**: Initiate a withdrawal request for your earned GOAT tokens.
4. **Confirmation**: Confirm the transaction via your wallet.
5. **Receive Rewards**: Your GOAT tokens will be transferred to your connected wallet.
