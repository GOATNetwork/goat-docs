# Sequencing Rewards
This guide will take you through the rewards for being a sequencer on the GOAT Network and how to claim them.

## Rewards
The mining rewards for sequencing are targeted to be 20% of the total fees generated by the network. The rewards are distributed to sequencers in the form of GOAT tokens on each block. Each 2 weeks, the amount of GOAT tokens rewarded per block is updated so that it rebalances to 20% of the total fees generated by the network.

## How to claim rewards
Once your Sequencer starts earning rewards, visit the Dashboard to view your unclaimed rewards. Click the "Claim" button to start a transaction and confirm or modify your wallet address in the popup window. The rewards will be sent to your address on GOAT Mainnet.
