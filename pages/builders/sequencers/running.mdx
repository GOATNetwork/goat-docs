# Running a GOAT Sequencer
To run a GOAT Sequencer, you need to meet a couple of system and network requirements, as well as meet the on-chain prerequisites. This guide will take you through the steps to ensure you have everything you need to run a GOAT Sequencer.


## Pre-requisites
Before you can run a GOAT Sequencer, you need to meet the following pre-requisites:
1. Submitted and passed a DAO proposal to become a sequencer. 
2. Have the technical know-how to smoothly run a GOAT Sequencer.
3. Have a security system in place to properly store and backup private key shards for MPC service nodes.
4. Follow the README.md to run a Sequencer node. After initializing the node, you will receive the Sequencer address, private key, and public key.

## System Requirements
To run a GOAT Sequencer, you need to meet the following system requirements:

| description| requirement|
| -------| ----|
| **CPU** | 16-core CPU |
| **RAM** | 32GB RAM |
| **Storage** | 1TB SSD |


## Get qualified to run a sequencer
<Steps>
### Get the skills
Sequencers are an integral part of the GOAT Network. It is important that all sequencers operate smoothly and therefore it is important that you have the technical know-how to run and maintain your Sequencer. 

### Know how to run Docker (recommended)
We recommend using Docker to run your Sequencer. It is recommended that you have a good understanding of Docker and how to run containers.

### Securily store private keys
You'll need to back up your private key to a secure location. This private key will be used for MPC service nodes and is crucial to the operation of your Sequencer. Make sure you have a secure system in place to store and backup your private key.

### Follow the README.md
After you have met the above requirements, follow the [README.md](https://github.com/MetisProtocol/metis-charts/blob/main/charts/metis-node/README.md) to run your Sequencer node. After initializing the node, you will receive the Sequencer address, private key, and public key.

## Register your sequencer
<Steps>
### Submit sequencer information
Once you've done the steps to get qualified to run a Sequencer, you'll need to submit your Sequencer information so that it can be displayed on the GOAT Decentralized Sequencer Dashboard. You do this by following these steps:
1. Go to the [GOAT Sequencer Resources Github](https://github.com/MetisProtocol/metis-sequencer-resources).
2. Make a pull request with the following information: 
```
name: The name of your Sequencer.
avatar: The image of your Sequencer.
url: A link to your website or x.com profile, Must be prefixed with https://
address: The whitelist address for sequencer lock-up. 
seq_addr: The sequencer address provided by the server after you run the Sequencer
pubkey: The public key provided by the server after you run the Sequencer.
desc: A brief description of yourself or your organization.

``` 

### Start the locking process
1. Go to the [Sequencer Page](https://sequencer.metis.io/)
2. Connect your wallet
3. If your wallet address is whitelisted, you will see a "Become a Sequencer" button. Click on it.
4. You will be prompted to setup your Sequencer. Follow the instructions we saw [previously](#follow-the-readmemd) to setup your Sequencer if you haven't already done so. 
5. Once you have setup your Sequencer, you will be prompted to lock up GOAT tokens. Follow the instructions to lock up your tokens.

### You're now a Sequencer!
After following this process, you're now a sequencer! 🎉

 Make sure you actively maintain your Sequencer node and network connection to prevent your deposited tokens from being slashed.
