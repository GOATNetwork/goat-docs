## Get Qualified to Run a Sequencer

<Steps>

### Technical Expertise

Sequencers are critical to GOAT Network's security and performance. You must demonstrate expertise in running high-availability infrastructure and blockchain nodes.

### Docker Environment

We use Docker for deployment. Ensure you're comfortable with Docker and container orchestration. Use the [GOAT Geth Docker container](https://github.com/goatnetwork/goat-geth/pkgs/container/goat-geth) for node setup.

### Secure Key Management

Implement robust security for private key management, including:

- Secure key generation
- Backup procedures
- MPC service node management
- Hardware security modules (recommended)

### Follow Deployment Guide

After approval, you'll receive access to the detailed deployment documentation.

</Steps>

## Register Your Sequencer

<Steps>

### Submit Sequencer Information

Once approved, submit your Sequencer information for the GOAT Dashboard:

```yaml
name: Your Sequencer name
avatar: Sequencer image URL
url: https://your-website-or-social
address: Whitelisted BTC address
seq_addr: Sequencer address (provided after setup)
pubkey: Public key (provided after setup)
desc: Brief description of your operation
```

### Complete the Lock-Up Process

1. Access the GOAT Sequencer Dashboard
2. Connect your whitelisted wallet
3. Lock up 2 BTC as security deposit
4. Complete node setup using provided instructions
5. Generate and submit required keys

### Maintain Your Sequencer

Ensure continuous operation to avoid penalties.
