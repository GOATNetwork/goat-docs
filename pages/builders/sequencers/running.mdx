# Running a GOAT Sequencer

<Callout type="warning">
  This guide is for running a Sequencer node, which is different from running a Validator node. Sequencers require a 100 BTC lock-up and special permissions. For validator information, see [Running a Validator](/builders/sequencers/validator).
</Callout>

## Pre-requisites
Before you can run a GOAT Sequencer, you need to meet the following pre-requisites:
1. Have 100 BTC available for the security deposit
2. Submit and pass the whitelisting process through GOAT DAO
3. Have the technical expertise to run and maintain a Sequencer
4. Have a security system in place for MPC service nodes
5. Follow the deployment documentation (provided after approval)

## System Requirements
To run a GOAT Sequencer, you need to meet the following system requirements:

| description| requirement|
| -------| ----|
| **CPU** | 16-core CPU |
| **RAM** | 32GB RAM |
| **Storage** | 1TB SSD |
| **Network** | High-availability connection |

## Get qualified to run a sequencer
<Steps>
### Technical Expertise
Sequencers are critical to GOAT Network's security and performance. You must demonstrate expertise in running high-availability infrastructure and blockchain nodes.

### Docker Environment
We use Docker for deployment. Ensure you're comfortable with Docker and container orchestration.

### Secure Key Management
Implement robust security for private key management, including:
- Secure key generation
- Backup procedures
- MPC service node management
- Hardware security modules (recommended)

### Follow Deployment Guide
After approval, you'll receive access to the detailed deployment documentation.
</Steps>

## Register your sequencer
<Steps>
### Submit sequencer information
Once approved, submit your Sequencer information for the GOAT Dashboard:

```yaml
name: Your Sequencer name
avatar: Sequencer image URL
url: https://your-website-or-social
address: Whitelisted BTC address
seq_addr: Sequencer address (provided after setup)
pubkey: Public key (provided after setup)
desc: Brief description of your operation
```

### Complete the lock-up process
1. Access the GOAT Sequencer Dashboard
2. Connect your whitelisted wallet
3. Lock up 100 BTC as security deposit
4. Complete node setup using provided instructions
5. Generate and submit required keys

### Maintain Your Sequencer
Ensure continuous operation to avoid penalties.
