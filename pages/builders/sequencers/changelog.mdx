## v0.3.0

Priority: **Medium** 

The purpose of this upgrade is to adjust the strategy of the gas price oracle, and change the the minimal priority fee to 0.005 gwei. 
* For wallets, Dapps, and other service providers, always use `eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas` to get the pritority fee.
* For RPC node and Validator maintainers, this upgrade introduces breaking changes to the database. Once upgraded, downgrading to a lower version is not possible. You may encounter higher cpu and disk I/O during the database migration.

This upgrade applies only to GOAT Geth, with version to `v0.3.0 for mainnet` and `v0.1.7 for testnet`. Download the docker compose file from [Gist](https://github.com/GOATNetwork/goat/tree/main/docker).

Upgrade Steps:
1. Upgrade all the RPC nodes.
2. Wait for confirmation from the GOAT Team.
3. Upgrade all the validators.
