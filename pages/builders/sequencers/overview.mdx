## Why Run a Sequencer Node?

Running a Sequencer Node on the GOAT Network offers several benefits:

- **Decentralized Infrastructure**: Participate in a decentralized network that enhances security and censorship resistance.
- **Bitcoin Settlement**: Leverage Bitcoin's security for transaction settlement.
- **Incentives**: Earn rewards for processing transactions and maintaining network integrity.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up a Sequencer Node, ensure you meet the following prerequisites:

1. **Locking Requirement**: 2 BTC is required as a security deposit.
2. **Whitelisting**: Contact the GOAT Network team to get whitelisted.
3. **Technical Expertise**: Experience in running high-availability infrastructure and blockchain nodes.
4. **Secure Key Management**: Implement robust security for private key management.

## System Requirements

### Hardware Configuration

- **CPU**: Equivalent to c5.2xlarge or similar
- **RAM**: 32GB
- **Storage**: 
  - Root directory with at least 40 GiB of space
  - EBS gp3, 100 GiB, 3000 IOPS, mounted to `/data`

### Network Configuration

- **IPv4 Elastic IP (EIP)** required
- **Security Group Rules**: Ensure your server's firewall allows inbound traffic on the following ports:
  - **30303**: goat-geth P2P (UDP/TCP)
  - **26656**: goat P2P Port (TCP)

### Software Environment

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04 or higher
- **Docker and Docker Compose**: For containerized deployment
- **Golang**: Latest stable version (currently 1.23)

## Deployment Steps

1. **Generate Sequencer Key**: Use the GOAT Docker container to generate your sequencer key.
2. **Start the Sequencer Node**: Set up and run your node using Docker Compose.
3. **Sync Status Check**: Monitor blockchain sync to ensure full synchronization.
4. **Locking Process**: Lock 2 BTC as a security deposit using the provided locking contract details.

## Locking Contract Details

- **Alpha Mainnet Address**: `0xbC10000000000000000000000000000000000004`
- **Testnet3 Address**: `0xbC10000000000000000000000000000000000004`

## Locking Asset Manager Operations

- **Safe Lock**: Securely lock your BTC.
- **Safe Unlock**: Unlock your BTC when needed.
- **Exit Sequencer Node**: Exit the network if necessary.

## Support Resources

- **RegTest Sequencer Node**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/GOATNetwork/goat-regtest)
