# Running a Sequencer Node

This guide provides detailed instructions on how to join **GOAT Network** and run a sequencer node(validator). 

<Callout type="info">
For the sake of clarity and to prevent any confusion, a sequencer node serves as the validator in this tutorial. The term "validator" is employed from the perspective of the decentralized network, whereas "sequencer node" is utilized from the perspective of the Bitcoin Layer 2 (L2).
</Callout>

## System Requirements

### Hardware Configuration

- **CPU**: Equivalent to c5.2xlarge or similar
- **Storage**:
  - Root directory with at least 40 GiB of space
  - EBS gp3, 100 GiB, 3000 IOPS, mount it to `/data`, and ensure that you can extend the size.

### Network Configuration

- **IPv4 Elastic IP (EIP)** required


#### Security Group Rules

| Port  | Description   | Protocol | Source    |
| ----- | ------------- | -------- | --------- |
| 30303 | goat-geth p2p | UDP      | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| 30303 | goat-geth p2p | TCP      | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| 26656 | goat p2p      | TCP      | 0.0.0.0/0 |

<Callout type="info">
  Ensure your server's firewall and network security settings allow inbound traffic on these ports.
</Callout>


### Software Environment

- **Operating System**: Linux(e.g. Ubuntu LTS)
- **Docker and Docker Compose**


## Deployment Steps

### Run the node

Fetch the `docker-compose.yml` from [Gist](https://github.com/GOATNetwork/goat/tree/main/docker) according to your network type,

Start the services:

```bash:pages/builders/sequencers/validator.mdx
docker-compose up -d
```

<Callout type="info">
 You must back up your validator key at path `/data/goat/config/priv_validator_key.json`
</Callout>

Check your node status by the following command,

```bash:pages/builders/sequencers/validator.mdx
docker-compose exec goat goatd status | jq
```

<Callout type="info">
  Wait for `"catching_up": false` to confirm full sync
</Callout>

## Becoming a validator

<Callout type="warning">
  Please note, we don't have a website to participate right now.
  Before you do below operations, you need to have enough Solidity and Linux operation experience.
</Callout>

#### The Locking Contract

The [Locking](https://github.com/GOATNetwork/goat-contracts/blob/main/contracts/locking/Locking.sol) contract is the entrypoint for your validator.

The address of the Locking contract is always `0xbC10000000000000000000000000000000000004`.

#### Locking Process

1. Get approval by contacting the GOAT Network team
2. Get creation proof on your instance

```bash:pages/builders/sequencers/validator.mdx
GOAT_VALIATOR_OWNER=0x # use your own address instead
GOAT_GETH_CHAIN_ID=`docker-compose exec geth geth attach --exec 'Number(eth.chainId())'`
docker-compose exec goat goatd modgen locking sign --owner $GOAT_VALIATOR_OWNER --eth-chain-id $GOAT_GETH_CHA
IN_ID
```

the `GOAT_VALIATOR_OWNER` variable is the node administrator's EVM address which is responsible for locking, redemption, and other operations.

After the last command, you'll get below result:

```json:pages/builders/sequencers/validator.mdx
{
 "owner": "0x",
 "pubkey": "0x2b4a44d655b6d5882f58997417320f98b9fcb9b9fb563ce089d462928a1bd0569359880e97221e5a8a1a5c1b4f012e61f4f75fc0937189600671532bcdb7cf0e",
 "signature": "0xe8d37ae31e755021b8dd63d1723730057998204d29a9f36b9464d82d3e47830051bca27cae8dd0ecd23e724ed74b031d0e14d1be3b9995f5a984dba947b2c3ee00",
 "validator": "0x3d2cc0ff49145113a46d576a269d291898c5138a"
}
```

3. Check if you have sufficient assets

You'll need to call `creationThreshold()` method of the Locking contract, for example:

```bash:pages/builders/sequencers/validator.mdx
cast call --json --rpc-url https://rpc.goat.network 0xbC10000000000000000000000000000000000004 'creationThreshold()((address,uint256)[])'
[
  "[(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000, 500000000000000000)]"
]
```

This is for mainnet, for another network, use corresponding `--rpc-url` instead.

the `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` represents native token(Bitcoin), and the `500000000000000000` represents the minimum amount to create a validator.

if the token address is not the zero address, you'll need to approve the locking contract to spend them.

4. Register your validator

You'll need to call `create()` method of the Locking contract, so that the command for mainnet is

```bash:pages/builders/sequencers/validator.mdx
VALIDATOR_PUBKEY=0x2b4a44d655b6d5882f58997417320f98b9fcb9b9fb563ce089d462928a1bd0569359880e97221e5a8a1a5c1b4f012e61f4f75fc0937189600671532bcdb7cf0e
VALIDATOR_SIGNATURE=0xe8d37ae31e755021b8dd63d1723730057998204d29a9f36b9464d82d3e47830051bca27cae8dd0ecd23e724ed74b031d0e14d1be3b9995f5a984dba947b2c3ee00
cast send --rpc-url https://rpc.goat.network 0xbC10000000000000000000000000000000000004 'create(bytes32[2],bytes32,bytes32,uint8)' \
  $VALIDATOR_PUBKEY "0x${VALIDATOR_SIGNATURE:2:66}" "0x${VALIDATOR_SIGNATURE:66:130}" "0x${VALIDATOR_SIGNATURE:130:132}"
```

Refer to step 2 for the `VALIDATOR_PUBKEY` and `VALIDATOR_SIGNATURE`.

There is also a [code example](https://github.com/GOATNetwork/goat-contracts/blob/main/task/lock.ts) for the above operations.
