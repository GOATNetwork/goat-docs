# Committee Signers

GOAT Network's trust-minimized Bitcoin bridge, relies on a set of Committee Signers to secure the bridge. The signers specifically by participate in an N-of-N signing protocol to secure deposits and enable the bridge's core functionality. These entities pre-sign the allowed spend rules in the BitVM2 transaction graph, emulating covenant-like restrictions on Bitcoin. As long as one signer remains honest, funds can only move along GOAT BitVM2's approved paths.

## Role of Committee Signers

Committee Signers are a group of N participants that:

- **Pre-sign BitVM2 transaction graphs** —Certain inputs in the transaction graph require Committee pre-signatures, establishing the allowed spending paths for bridge operations.
- **Commit the active sequencer set to Bitcoin** — The Committee commits the active decentralizer sequencer set to Bitcoin, anchoring the L2 state to Bitcoin's security.
- **Verify operator qualifications** — Before pre-signing, Committee members verify that operators have sufficient stake locked on GOAT to participate in bridge operations based on the locking contract.
- **Enable deposit confirmations** — Committee members sign Peg-In-Confirm transactions and the Graph digest, allowing users to receive PegBTC on GOAT.

The bridge uses an N-of-N signing scheme for deposits where the bridge remains secure as long as at least one signer's key is secure and at least one signer remains honest.

## Committee Roles & Workflow

The following describes the specific roles that committee signers take in the deposit progress, sequencer set commitment, and operator unlock verification. 

### Deposit (Peg-In) Process

1. User initiates a Peg-In request via the L2 contract
2. Committee members validate the request and respond on-chain
3. Once a threshold is reached, the participating Committee set is finalized
4. Committee members verify the Operator's stake on the L2 and pre-sign the BitVM2 transaction Graph
5. Committee members sign both the Peg-In-Confirm transaction and the Graph digest
6. A Relayer aggregates Committee signatures and broadcasts Peg-In-Confirm
7. After Bitcoin confirmation, the user receives PegBTC on Layer 2

### Sequencer Set Commitment

The Committee commits the sequencer set's public keys to Bitcoin using a chain of pre-signed transactions. This ensures any change to the L2 Sequencer set is approved by a sufficient number (e.g., 2/3) of the current sequencer members and is anchored on Bitcoin. 

The commitment process involves two key transaction types:

- Sequencer-Update — Triggers and organizes the update process
- Sequencer-Commit — Carries the hash commitment of the next cycle's Sequencer set, signed by a majority of sequencers

### L2 Committee Management

The **CommitteeManagement** contract on the L2 is a multisig contract that manages:

- Committee member registration
- Member rotation
- Member exit procedures

This contract leverages GOAT’s decentralized sequencer network to achieve consensus on committee changes.

### Operator Unlock Verification

To unlock funds from the locking contract, an operator must:

1. Submit an unlock request to the Committee with proof that all relevant transactions have been fully processed or discarded
2. The Committee verifies the proof
3. If valid, a sufficient number of Committee members sign to approve the request
4. With enough Committee signatures, the unlock transaction is submitted

## Security Guarantees

The Committee signer set provides the following security guarantees:

- 1-of-N Honesty — The bridge is secure as long as at least one signer remains honest and maintains their private key security
- Covenant Emulation — Pre-signed transactions ensure funds can only move along approved paths defined in the transaction graph
- No Single Point of Failure — Multiple independent Committee members distribute trust across the signing set
- Dual Slashing Security — Combines native slashing in Bitcoin's verification layer with GOAT's consensus layer penalties

## Universal Operator Abstraction

GOAT BitVM2 introduces the **Universal Operator** concept, which consolidates system roles (Prover, Challenger, Sequencer, and Designated Verifier) into a single Operator identity. Universal Operators:

- Stake tokens on L2
- Are assigned different roles in rotating epochs
- Balance economics by rotating through both profit-generating and cost-incurring roles
- Improve system reliability through role redistribution if an Operator fails

This design mitigates centralization risks and supports a sustainable incentive mechanism while maintaining the 1-of-n honesty assumption for network security.
